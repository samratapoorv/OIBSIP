# irisclassifier
Overview :-
This is a simple implementation of a Logistic Regression model on the Iris dataset using the scikit-learn library. The program loads the Iris dataset, splits it into training and testing sets, trains a Logistic Regression model on the training data, makes predictions on the testing data, and evaluates the performance of the model using different metrics.

Dependencies:-
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn

Usage
Clone the repository to your local machine
Navigate to the repository directory
Install the required dependencies by running pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the program by executing python logistic_regression_iris.py
Evaluation Metrics
Accuracy: The percentage of correct predictions made by the model
Confusion Matrix: A matrix that summarizes the performance of a classifier in terms of true and false positives and negatives
Classification Report: A report that includes various evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score
Conclusion
This program provides a simple example of how to implement a Logistic Regression model on the Iris dataset using scikit-learn. The program demonstrates how to evaluate the performance of the model using different metrics. You can use this code as a starting point to build more complex models and explore other machine learning algorithms.
